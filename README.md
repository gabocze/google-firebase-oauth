Make a user authentication through Firebase OAuth service. A Firebase app was created and OAuth enabled therein. In the .html goes the generated API Key from Firebase. The Firebase and the App Engine Apps do not need to belong on the same project neither the same user account.
The whole set-up yields a user login form handled by Firebase that returns the controk back to the App Engine's App after completing the login.
